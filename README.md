# Compiling The Code


Compiling the code with the MinGW compiler, which must be installed locally. After installation, set a System Variable Path to MinGW's bin folder. To see if the installation worked, open Command Prompt and type gcc --version. If it worked, go to the root directory Algorithm_Design_Homework and run gcc -o main.c utils.c.

In any compatible IDE, create a blank project and import the following files:main.c, utils.c and utils.h.
